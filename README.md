# Leave Management

## A Udemy course by Trevoir Williams

Leave Management is a project built in the course [Complete ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework Development](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-aspnet-core-31-and-entity-framework-development).  It is a simple HR management CRUD app.  The instructor, Trevoir Williams, covers project and database setup, the Repository Pattern, authentication with Microsoft's Identity tools, logging with Serilog and Seq, separation of concerns, and publishing to IIS and Azure.

The concepts that I enjoyed learning about while completing this course are the Repository Pattern and logging.  Testing was not covered at all, but the author has another course specifically for testing which I intend to complete soon.
